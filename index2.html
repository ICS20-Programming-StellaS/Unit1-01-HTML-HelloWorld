  <p>Let's begin!</p>
  <h3>Something that interests me is the World Refugee Crisis.</h3>
    <p>To start, I'm so lucky to live in a safe and free country. But, millions aren't as lucky as me. This topic interests me because millions of people around the world face leaving their home and risking their lives in search of somewhere better. Just reading about what millions are going through or have gone through really opens your eyes to what people risk their lives for and what people take for granted. This is why this topic interests me.  </p>
